if A is the return segment of B, do we have to also make B the return segment of A?
From the test case, if we don't, it got segmentation fault.

Changes engineObject_ to be protected and only provides engineObject() in the Location class and removed the engineObject() in its subclass.
This is because in the following code:

if (name == "source") {
    Ptr<Location> location = manager_->cast_instance<Location, LocationRep>(v);
    engineObject_->sourceIs(location);
    location->segmentIs(engineObject_);
} 

manager_->cast_instance always returns an arbitrary pointer to the location due to the process:
1. Fetch the rep instance of v, in which we get a LocationRep object
2. Call this object's engineObject(), which returns Ptr<Location> and store that in location.
The problem is, this location is the member variable of Location (Ptr<Location> engineObject) rather than like Terminal or Customer, and is not instantiated when a Terminal or Customer object is created, for the constructors of Terminal and Customer only instantiate Ptr<Terminal> and Ptr<Customer> without instantiated their parent class (Location)
's engine object.
